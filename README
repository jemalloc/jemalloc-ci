These scripts simplify bringing up buildbot worker and master nodes.

They rely on various config data placed in json files in a "~/secrets"
directory.

The files:
~/secrets/public.json:
{
    "admin_email": "...",
    "master_host": "...",
    "github_organization": "...",
    "github_repo": "...",
    "github_trusted_users": [
        "user1", "user2", ...
    ]
}

Most of these are self-explanatory. The "github_trusted_users" key tells
buildbot whose pull requests to allow workers to build and test (otherwise,
anyone could take over a worker account by submitting a pull request).


~/secrets/[ubuntu|freebsd]_bb_secrets.json:
{
  "bb_un": "...",
  "bb_pw": "..."
}


~/secrets/[ubuntu|freebsd|master]_unix_secrets.json:
{
  "unix_un": "...",
  "unix_pw": "..."
}

These give the unix accounts on the worker machines that the various services run as.


~/secrets/master_bb_secrets.json:
{
  "github_access_token": "..."
}

github_access_token is used to set build status on pull requests (and so knows
that capability to be granted on github's side).



To set up the master (currently, only ubuntu master is supported):
(as root)
cd ubuntu-master
./setup-system.sh
./setup-nginx.sh
./setup-bb-master-account.sh
(after becoming master, and changing to the master's home directory, with a
checkout of jemalloc-ci):
./setup-bb-master.sh
./start-bb-master.sh

To set up the worker (currently, only ubuntu and freebsd are supported):
(as root)
./setup-[ubuntu|freebsd]-worker-system.sh
WORKER_UNIX_SECRETS_FILE=[ubuntu|freebsd]_unix_secrets.json ./setup-worker-account.sh
(after su-ing to the worker, in the worker's checkout of jemalloc-ci):
./setup-bb-worker.sh
./start-bb-worker.sh

To set up a master, root's secrets directory must include
master_unix_secrets.json and public.json. The master account's secrets
directory must include public.json, [freebsd|ubuntu]_bb_secrets.json, and
master_bb_secrets.json.

To set up a worker, root's secrets directory must include
[freebsd|ubuntu]_unix_secrets.json. The worker account's secrets directory must
include [freebsd|ubuntu]_bb_secrets.json and public.json.
